Flyweight Design Pattern (java.lang.String, java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int)
* Used when more efficient use of memory is needed
* Used when you have a large number of similar objects
* Used for immutable objects
* Where most of the object states can be extrinsic

Design
* A Pattern of patterns
* Utilises a Factory pattern  
* Encompasses Creation and Structure
* Client, FlyweightFactory Flyweight, ConcreteFlyweight

Pitfalls
* Complex pattern
* Don't usually want to prematurely optimize (bad design??)
* Must understand Factory pattern to use flyweight
* Not just a graphical pattern

Flyweight                            vs        	Facade
* Memory optimization							* Refactoring pattern
* Optimization pattern							* Simplified client
* Immutable Objects								* Provides a different interface
